# operatory precedence is a very important topic in mathematics. Really does'nt have much
# to do with python. It uses the BODMAS method
# when writing python mathematical operaitons, python will follow the precedence.
# Here they are in order of importance
# Brackets, Exponent, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction
# e.g
x = (2 + 2) ** 2 - 3 * 2 + 1
print(x)
